## Project Overview
Our project aims to analyze seismic data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic events and predict potential earthquakes. By exercising our knowledge of data structures, algorithms and data analysis, we strive to enhance our understanding of planetary seismic activity.
